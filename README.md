# kyleborot_portfolio_site
In-progress portfolio site that will show all my software developer skills, including projects, work experience, and interactive pages that showcase my abilities.
Developing in a React TS frontend, a Python backend, an integrated SQL database. Will be deployed on AWS for wide public access.

If you want to use this project's structure, please fork it and run npm install in the frontend folder to get all of your node dependencies necessary for frontend deployment.

Here is a Gantt Chart that I made to track my project progress and ensure I stay on time with my deliverables. Branches will reflect the ticket numbers on the chart (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
